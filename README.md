# Challenge1-Complex-Workflow
A complex workflow that uses a push trigger, multiple runners with different operating systems and jobs that use dependencies. Start this challenge by creating a workflow file in a new repository. Use a push trigger to get the workflow started. The workflow should contain four jobs. Each job should run a command that prints the date. In the first job, use the Ubuntu-latest runner. In the second job use the Windows-latest runner. In the third job, use the macOS-latest runner. In the fourth and final job, use the runner of your choice. For the fourth job, create a dependency on the previous three jobs.
